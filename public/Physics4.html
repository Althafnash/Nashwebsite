                <p>Light is an electro magnatic wave that travels thought space</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Light is the ultimate  natural resource Light is an electromagnetic wave  on reflecting  an object create colours we see </p>
                <h1>1.How can we see</h1>
                <p>We see with aid of our eyes but is only eye important </p>

                <h1> 3.Transmission of Light though objects </h1>
                <p>We can do an activity to find out how Light transmits thought different objects</p>
                <p>We will need</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>	A metal sheets</li>

                  <li>	A thin piece of glass</li>
                  <li>	different types of polyethene sheet</li>
                  <li>	a black colour papers </li>
                  <li>	Tissues of different colours </li>
                  <li>	A piece of newspaper</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Method</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>	Cut  a square of 3cm by 3cm in the middle of the carboard </li>
                    <li>	Light the candle</li>
                    <li>	Keep each of the objects middle of the cardboard and the flame</li>
                    <li>	Move the objects toward the flame and observe the flame from the object</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Observation </h1>
                 <ol>
                     <li>	In some object the flame and Light can be seen</li>
                     <li> 	In some objects the Light can be see but the flame cannot be seen </li>
                     <li>	In some object both Light and flame cannot be seen</li>

                 <ol>
                     <li>	The objects where the observed object and Light can be seen is called transparent object</li>
                     <li>	The objects where the observed object cannot be seen but Light can be seen is called translucentobject</li>
                     <li>	The objects where the observed object and Light cannot be seen is called opaque  object</li>
