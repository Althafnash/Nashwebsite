                <h1>Sunk Cost Fallacy</h1>
                <p>The sunk cost fallacy is most dangerous when we have invested a lot of time, money, or energy in something.</p>
                <p>This investment becomes a reason to carry on even if we are dealing with a lost cause.</p>
                <p>The more we invest, the greater the sunk cost and the greater the urge to continue it becomes.</p>
                <p>Of course, there may be good reasons to continue investing in something to finalize it, but beware of doing so for the wrong reasons.</p>
                <p>Rational decision-making requires you to forget about the costs incurred to date, no matter how much you have already invested. Only your assessment of the future costs and benefits count.</p>
