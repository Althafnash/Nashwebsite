                <h1>Separation Methods</h1>
                <p>Elements are substances that cannot be split into anything simpler by chemical means.</p>
                <p>An element contains only one type of atom.</p>
                <p>Compounds are formed when two or more elements are combined chemically.</p>
                <p>The elements always combine in a fixed ratio.</p>
                <p>In a mixture, the various substances are mixed together, and no chemical reactions occur.</p>
                <p>Mixtures can be made from elements or/and compounds.</p>
                <p>Mixtures can be separated by physical means; physical means include changing temperature or dissolving a part of the mixture in a solvent.</p>
                <p>Pure substances, such as elements and pure compounds, melt and boil at a fixed temperature.</p>
                <p>Filtration can be used to separate a solid from a liquid.</p>
                <p>The substance left in the filter paper is called the residue.</p>
                <p>The liquid that comes through is known as the filtrate.</p>
                <p>Crystallization can be used to separate a solute from a solution.</p>
                <p>We can use filtration and crystallization to obtain pure salt from rock salt.</p>
                <p>Rock salt consists of salt contaminated by earthly or rocky impurities; these impurities are not soluble in water.</p>
                <p>If you crush the rock salt and mix it with hot water, the salt dissolves but the impurities do not. The impurities can be filtered off and remain on the filter paper.</p>
                <p>The filtrate is then a salt solution. The solid salt can be obtained from the solution by crystallization.</p>
                <p>Simple distillation can be used to separate the components of a solution.</p>
                <p>Fractional distillation is used to separate a mixture of liquids.</p>
                <p>Paper chromatography can be used to separate a variety of mixtures.</p>
                <p>Paper chromatography can also be used to separate a mixture of colorless substances such as sugar.</p>
