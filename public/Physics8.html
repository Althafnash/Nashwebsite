                <h1>Motion - Introduction</h1>
                <p>Motion is the movement of a living thing from one place to another.</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>1. Displacement</p>
                    <p>2. Distance</p>
                    <p>3. Speed</p>
                    <p>4. Velocity</p>
                    <p>5. Acceleration</p>
                </ol>

                <h1>1. Displacement</h1>
                <p>A change of position from one point to another in a particular direction is called displacement.</p>
                <p>Example: An athlete runs on a track from point A to point B, covering a distance of 200 m. The displacement of the athlete is indicated by the straight line AB. The magnitude of his displacement is 160 m, and its direction is 70 degrees from north to west. This displacement can be expressed as:</p>
                <strong><p>160 m in the direction 70 degrees from north to west.</p></strong>
                <hr>
                <h1>2. Distance</h1>
                <p>Distance is the total length traveled by an object.</p>
                <hr>
                <h1>3. Speed</h1>
                <p>Speed is the rate at which a given distance is traversed.</p>
                <p>Speed is calculated by:</p>
                <strong><p>Speed = distance / time</p></strong>
                <p>(Speed is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.)</p>
                <p><strong>Since time is given in seconds and distance in meters, the speed has the unit m/s.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>3 m/s (read as 3 meters per second)</strong></p>
                <p>We have a vehicle traveling for 6 seconds:</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>0s - 0m</p>
                    <p>1s - 3m</p>
                    <p>2s - 6m</p>
                    <p>3s - 9m</p>
                    <p>4s - 12m</p>
                    <p>5s - 15m</p>
                    <p>6s - 18m</p>
                </ol>
                <p>If we divide the minutes traveled by the distance traveled at the first second, we get 3 - 0 = 0.</p>
                <p>Distance traveled during the next second = 6 - 3 = 3.</p>
                <p>The vehicle travels with 3 m/s speed in a uniform phase; this is known as uniform or constant speed.</p>
                <p>Average speed is calculated using:</p>
                <strong>Average Speed = Total Distance Traveled / Total Time Duration</strong>
                <p>In words: <strong>Average Speed equals total distance traveled divided by total time taken.</strong></p>
                <p>A vehicle has traveled for 6 seconds, covering 18 meters:</p>
                <strong>6s / 18m = 3 m/s</strong>
                <hr>
                <h1>4. Velocity</h1>
                <p>Velocity is displacement / time.</p>
                <p><strong>Velocity equals displacement divided by time.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Velocity = displacement / time</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The SI unit of velocity is m/s.</strong></p>
                <hr>
                <h1>5. Acceleration</h1>
                <p>Change of velocity is calculated by:</p>
                <strong>Initial Velocity - Final Velocity</strong>
