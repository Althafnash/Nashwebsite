                <h1>The Arrangement of Particles in Matter</h1>

                <h3>The Arrangement of Particles in a Solid</h3>
                <p>In a solid, the particles are usually arranged regularly and packed closely together.</p>
                <p>The particles are only able to vibrate in fixed positions; they cannot move around.</p>
                <p>The particles have strong attractive forces between them, which keep them together.</p>

                <h3>The Arrangement of Particles in a Liquid</h3>
                <p>In a liquid, the particles are touching, but some gaps have appeared.</p>
                <p>This is why liquids are less dense than solids.</p>
                <p>The forces between the particles are less effective, allowing the particles to move around each other.</p>
                <p>The particles in a liquid are arranged randomly.</p>

                <h3>The Arrangement of Particles in a Gas</h3>
                <p>The particles in a gas are moving randomly at high speeds in all directions.</p>
                <p>In a gas, the particles are much further apart, and there are (almost) no forces attracting them.</p>

                <p>The kinetic energy of particles in different states of matter:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solid < Liquid < Gas</li>
                </ul>
