                <h1>social proof</h1>
                <p>A simpe experiment carried out in the 1950s by legendary psycologsist solomon asch shws how peer presure can wrap common sense</p>
                <p>A subject is show a line drawn on paper and next to it three times -numbered 1,2and 3 - one shoter and longer and another one the same size of the orginal</p>
                <p>He or she must inicate which of the three lines corresponds to the orginal one </p>
                <p>If the person is alone in thee room he gives the corect answer because the task is realy simple </p>
                <p>Now other five people enter the room which the subject dsoe not say </p>
                <p>one after te other they give the wrong answer like number 1 and number 2 it is although it is very clear number 3 is the correct answer </p>
                <p>then in the subjects trun again in one thrid of the time he will answer incorrecly to match the other persons response </p>
                <p>Why do we are actlike this well in the past following others was a good survival stargy</p>
                <p>Suprise that fifty thousad years ago you were travelling around sereengets with your hunter-gather friends and suddenly all are bottled </p>
                <p>What would you have done would you have stayed put straching your head and weighing up wheather what you weee klooking at is a lion or something that looked like a lion but infact was a harmless animal</p>
                <p>No you would have sprinted after your friends later on when you were afe you could have reflected on what had actually happened </p>
                <p>Those who acted differenlly and i am sure there were some exited the gene pool</p>
                <p>We are driect hers of those who copied the others behaviour  </p>
                <p>This patten is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today even when it offers no survival advantage</p>
