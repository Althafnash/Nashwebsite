                <h1>Social Proof</h1>
                <p>A simple experiment carried out in the 1950s by legendary psychologist Solomon Asch shows how peer pressure can warp common sense.</p>
                <p>A subject is shown a line drawn on paper and next to it three lines—numbered 1, 2, and 3—one shorter, one longer, and one the same size as the original.</p>
                <p>He or she must indicate which of the three lines corresponds to the original one.</p>
                <p>If the person is alone in the room, he or she gives the correct answer because the task is really simple.</p>
                <p>Now, other five people enter the room, whom the subject does not know.</p>
                <p>One after the other, they give the wrong answer, saying number 1 or number 2, although it is very clear that number 3 is the correct answer.</p>
                <p>Then, in the subject’s turn again, in one-third of the time, he or she will answer incorrectly to match the other persons’ responses.</p>
                <p>Why do we act like this? Well, in the past, following others was a good survival strategy.</p>
                <p>Imagine that fifty thousand years ago you were traveling around the Serengeti with your hunter-gatherer friends, and suddenly everyone starts to bolt.</p>
                <p>What would you have done? Would you have stayed put, scratching your head and weighing up whether what you were looking at was a lion or something that looked like a lion but was, in fact, a harmless animal?</p>
                <p>No, you would have sprinted after your friends. Later on, when you were safe, you could have reflected on what had actually happened.</p>
                <p>Those who acted differently—and I’m sure there were some—would have exited the gene pool.</p>
                <p>We are direct heirs of those who copied others’ behavior.</p>
                <p>This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today, even when it offers no survival advantage.</p>
