                <h1>Simple Machines</h1>
                <p>Some of the simple machines we use are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lever</li>
                    <li>Inclined plane</li>
                    <li>Wheel and axle</li>
                    <li>Pulley</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Parts of a simple machine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Load</li>
                    <li>Effort</li>
                    <li>Fulcrum</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The force applied downward is known as effort.</p>
                <p>The weight lifted is known as load.</p>
                <p>The point at which the machine is in contact is known as the fulcrum.</p>
                <p>The arm from the load to the fulcrum is known as the load arm.</p>
                
                <h1>Calculation on Simple Machines</h1>
                <h3>Calculations on the Lever</h3>
                <p>The advantage of the machine is calculated by the ratio of load to effort, which is known as mechanical advantage.</p>
                <p>Mechanical advantage = load / effort</p>
                <p>The velocity ratio is the ratio of the displacement of the load to the displacement of the effort.</p>
                <p>Work done on the machine is known as work input.</p>
                <p>Work input = effort * displacement of effort</p>
                <p>Work done by the machine is known as work output.</p>
                <p>Work output = load * displacement of load</p>
                <p>Efficiency of a machine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficiency = work output / work input</li>
                    <li>Efficiency = load * displacement of load / effort * displacement of effort</li>
                    <li>Efficiency = load / effort * distance traveled by load / distance traveled by effort</li>
                    <li>Efficiency = mechanical advantage * 1 / velocity ratio</li>
                    <li>Efficiency = mechanical advantage / velocity ratio * 100%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We can use the same formulas for the inclined plane.</p>
                <p>In the wheel and axle, the calculation for the velocity ratio changes:</p>
                <p>Length of the handle equals the radius of the circle = r</p>
                <p>If the diameter of the circle is 2r, then the circumference is 2r * π</p>
                <p>If the radius of the cylinder stem is r2, then the diameter is 2r2.</p>
                <p>The distance that the load is lifted for one turn of the handle is 2πr2.</p>
                <p>The velocity ratio of the wheel and axle = circumference of the handle in one turn / circumference of the wheel.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>= 2πr1 / 2πr2</li>
                    <li>= r1 / r2</li>
                    <li>= radius of the wheel / radius of the axle</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the pulley, the velocity ratio and the efficiency change:</p>
                <p>Mechanical advantage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>= effort / load</li>
                    <li>= 12N / 12N</li>
                    <li>= 1N</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The efficiency = mechanical advantage / velocity ratio.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>= 1 / 1 * 100%</li>
                    <li>= 100%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In a pulley, the efficiency is always 100%.</p>
                <p>The pulley in a well is known as a stationary pulley.</p>
                <p>The pulley in a bicycle riding fast along a horizontal road has to climb up the hill.</p>
                <p>This is known as the pulley system.</p>
