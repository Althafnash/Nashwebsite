                <h1>Atoms</h1>
                <p>An atom is the smallest piece of an element that can be recognized as that element.</p>
                <p>Atoms are made of three subatomic particles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proton</li>
                    <li>Neutron</li>
                    <li>Electron</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is called its atomic number or proton number.</p>
                <p>The mass number (sometimes known as the nucleon number) counts the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.</p>
                <p>A molecule is a combination of two or more atoms chemically bonded together.</p>
                <p>Atoms with the same atomic number but different relative atomic masses are called isotopes.</p>
                <p>Relative atomic mass is the average mass of an atom, taking into account the amount of each isotope present in a naturally occurring sample of an element.</p>
                <p>Atoms are electrically neutral (they have no overall charge). The charge on a proton (+) is equal but opposite to the charge on an electron (-); therefore, the charge in the atom is 0.</p>
                <p>Number of protons = Number of electrons.</p>
                <p>The search for patterns in chemistry led to the creation of the periodic table.</p>
                <p>The vertical columns are called groups.</p>
                <p>The columns are numbered from 1 to 7, and the eighth column is numbered 0.</p>
                <p>You can use the periodic table to work out the number of protons, electrons, and neutrons in an atom.</p>
                <p>The number of neutrons in an atom = mass number - atomic number.</p>
                <p>The electrons move around the nucleus in a series of levels called energy levels or shells:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1st energy level = 2</li>
                    <li>2nd energy level = 8</li>
                    <li>3rd energy level = 18</li>
                    <li>4th energy level = 32</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The first energy level is closest to the nucleus.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of electrons in an atom is called electronic configuration.</p>
                <p>Elements in the same group in the periodic table have the same number of electrons in their outer shells.</p>
                <p>The number of electrons in the outer shell is the same as the group number for groups 1 to 7.</p>
                <p>The period number corresponds to the number of occupied shells or the highest occupied shell.</p>
                <p>All the elements in group 1 react vigorously with water to form hydrogen and hydroxides with similar formulas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>LiOH</li>
                    <li>NaOH</li>
                    <li>KOH</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All the elements in group 7 react with hydrogen to form compounds with similar formulas:</p>
                <p>All the elements in group 2 form chlorides with similar formulas.</p>
                <p>The group 0 elements are known as noble gases.</p>
                <p>They are non-reactive.</p>
