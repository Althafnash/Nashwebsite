                <h1>The Social Organization of Ancient Society</h1>
                <p>Ancient people had a well-organized hierarchy.</p>
                <p>There are two types of hierarchy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vertical hierarchy</li>
                    <li>Horizontal hierarchy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The hierarchy in which power flows from the top down is known as a vertical hierarchy.</p>
                <p>e.g., King → Minister → Government officers</p>
                <p>The hierarchy in which power is distributed equally is known as a horizontal hierarchy.</p>
                <p>e.g., Ministers, Army generals, Treasurers</p>
                <p>The Buddhist clergy held the highest position in social organization as they advised the government.</p>
                <p>The king delegated authority to Buddhist temples to collect taxes from the 1st and 2nd centuries.</p>
                <p>Rich merchants, naval captains, doctors, and teachers were considered the chieftains of society in ancient times.</p>
                <p>There were farmers, shepherds, potters, gem cutters, blacksmiths, and people engaged in other work.</p>
                <p>Slaves were at the lowest level of society; their duty was to engage in various activities, and they did not have any freedom.</p>
                <p>There were two types of slaves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anuwaryathadasa — Slaves by lineage</li>
                    <li>Dhanakeethadasa — Slaves by mercenary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The inscription mentions an officer who goes to the villages, notes the villagers' problems, and then informs the government officials, who then inform the king.</p>
                <p>This inscription, created by the kings of the Mannawarmma lineage, mentions the law institutions they used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wadala — King's court / legislature</li>
                    <li>Sabawa — Judiciary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The people who maintained these laws were known as Mekkeper (Security officers).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>e.g., Panakaduwa copper plate</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD mention laws regarding irrigation, administration, and charging taxes for using state lands.</p>
                <p>One-sixth of the production had to be paid to the government as tax.</p>
                <p>The main types of taxes charged under the tax law:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dakapaathi
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taxes paid for using tanks</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bojakapathi
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cultivating the lands of the king</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mataramajibaka
                        <ul>
                            <li>Catching fish in water</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>There was a judiciary for the administration of punishment for those who broke the laws.</p>
                <p>An inscription made by King Gajabahu I in the Sithupawa inscription mentions such a high court. The inscription describes that the fines charged by the Great Hall of Justice in the area were offered to the monks in the Sithupawa temple by the king for their provisions.</p>
                <p>The Kandawattwana inscriptions, which belong to the 9th century AD, mention a law of charging a fine of kalana from those who did not plough their lands at the proper time.</p>
                <p>The Sorabora Wewa inscription, made by King Udaya III, describes laws imposed by the king to prevent fraud in the government market in a place called Hopitigamuwa.</p>
                <p>Some of the laws mentioned are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taxes should be charged to those who are engaged in business in the Hopitigamuwa trade area, but taxes should not be charged to passers-by.</li>
                    <li>Twice the amount of taxes should be charged from those who do their business without showing it to the officers.</li>
                    <li>The unstandardized madathiya units should not be used for scaling goods in business.</li>
                    <li>Areca nuts and betel should only be sold by keeping them in huts made of them.</li>
                    <li>An oil tax should be charged from those engaged in business on poya days.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the first time in history, a law stating "No animals should be killed" was imposed by Amandagamini Abaya, known as the Magathi law.</p>
                <p>The Mihintale inscription, made by King Mahinda IV, mentions that a law states that the death sentence is given to those who kill buffalo, cows, oxen, and goats.</p>
                <p>King Nissankamalla made a law that states that birds in the reservoir should not be killed.</p>
                <p>The Wewalketiya inscription, made by King Mahinda IV, provides the following description:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Death sentence for crimes such as murder and stealing.</li>
                    <li>When cattle thieves are caught, the cattle should be given back to the owners, and the skin of the cattle should be marked on the head of the thieves with a heated iron.</li>
                    <li>The responsibility of catching the cattle thief is given to the villagers of the village in which the thief resides.</li>
                    <li>The village should pay a tax until they catch the hiding criminals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The barter system was mostly used in ancient Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>The oldest coins are known as Hasebu, Kahapana, or Kahawanu coins.</p>
                <p>There was also a system of independent coins.</p>
                <p>The kings also issued some of their own coins during their ruling period.</p>
                <p>The officers in charge of molding coins were known as Rupa Adeyasha (Pictorial Director).</p>
                <p>This appears in an inscription from the 2nd century BC as Rupadaka.</p>
                <p>Metal weighing was also used as a means of exchange in our country.</p>
                <p>An inscription discovered in Weesigiriya, which belonged to the 10th century, mentions that King Kasyapa IV had offered 200 ran kalan (golden pieces of kalan) to Buddhist monks who stayed in a Buddhist temple called Veerakuru.</p>

                <p>The bhikkhus said to Queen Vihara Maha Devi, "You have gained wealth and a luxurious life because you made meritorious deeds in your past life." Vihara Maha Devi replied, "There is no happiness or luxury in life without sons and daughters."</p>
                <p>A girl, when she reached 16, was qualified to marry, and girls had to be protected until they were qualified to get married.</p>
                <p>Women were expected to be good cooks.</p>
                <p>The Saddharmalankaraya describes that Prince Saliya's wife Ashakamal won the hearts of everyone in the king's palace by making delicious food.</p>
