                <h1>Confirmation Bias</h1>
                <p>Confirmation bias is the mother of all misconceptions.</p>
                <p>It is the tendency to interpret new information so that it becomes compatible with our existing beliefs, theories, and convictions.</p>
                <p>In other words, we filter out any information that contradicts our existing beliefs (disconfirming evidence).</p>
                <p>This is a dangerous practice. Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored, said writer Aldous Huxley.</p>
                <p>However, we do exactly that. As super-investor Warren Buffett knows, what human beings are best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.</p>
                <p>Charles Darwin, since his youth, set out to fight confirmation bias systematically.</p>
                <p>Whenever observations contradicted his theory, he took them very seriously and noted them immediately.</p>
                <p>He knew that the brain actively forgets disconfirming evidence after a short while.</p>
                <p>The more he judged his theories to be correct, the more actively he looked for contradictions.</p>
                <p>Set out to find disconfirming evidence. Axing beliefs that feel like old friends is hard but imperative.</p>
