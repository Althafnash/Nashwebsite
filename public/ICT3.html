                <h1>System devlopment Life cylcle</h1>
                <P>A system is a collection of components that interact together to achieve a specific task </P>
                <p>A system converts data into information</p>
                <p>Manual system </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors are minimal which data processed by a computer program</li>
                    <li>Since there data is inserted manually processed there is room for more error </li>
                    <li>Processing of data is less efficien</li>
                    <li>Requires a large space for storage of data </li>
                    <li>Data is open to lots of threats</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some of the advantages of using a computer based syatem are </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors are minimal which data processed by a computer program</li>
                    <li>Data can be processed more efficiently</li>
                    <li>Large amount of data can be stored in a small physical surface such as a database </li>
                    <li>Security can be ensured with backups and the use of passwords </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Stages of system development life cycle</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification of requirements</li>
                    <li>Designing the solution</li>
                    <li>Coding of the solution</li>
                    <li>Testing and debugging</li>
                    <li>Deployment of the system</li>
                    <li>Maintenance of the system</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some ways of identifying requirements</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Observing</li>
                    <li>Interviews</li>
                    <li>Questioners</li>
                    <li>Document sample collection </li>
                    <li>Prototyping</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Key points when we design a software</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification of software and software architecture</li>
                    <li>User interface</li>
                    <li>Identification of main hardware system and its components</li>
                    <li>Identification of dependency of each sub system</li>
                    <li>Deciding on the hardware and software to run in the computer </li>
                    <li>Designing infrastructure for the software database and user interface </li>
                    <li>Planning of tests </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The next step is to code the system using a suitable computer language </p>
                <p>The main objective of testing and debugging is minimize the error in the above steps </p>
                <p>There are few phase in testing </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unit testing</li>
                    <li>Integration testing</li>
                    <li>System testing</li>
                    <li>Acceptance testing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each unit in the system is tested input are testing in accordance with the output this is called unit testing </p>
                <p>Units that are already tested and debugged are integrated to form the complete system and the integrated system is tested this is called integration testing </p>
                <p>The complete system is tested for it is output for the provided input  this is called system testing </p>
                <p>Acceptance of user is tested at last and this is known as acceptance testing </p>
                <p>There are few different types of deployment </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct deployment</li>
                    <li>Parallel deployment</li>
                    <li>Pilot deployment</li>
                    <li>Phased deployment </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Direct deployment means the existing system is totally terminated and then the new system is installed </p>
                <p>Parallel deployment is when the existing system and the new system are use parallel</p>
                <p>Pilot deployment is about using the newly developed system in a selected area</p>
                <p>In phased deployment the new system is deployed in stages success of one stage leads to the next and completing the new system </p>
                <p>A system once installed and in use for a certain period needs to be maintained well with system maintenance the following may be required</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adopting new technology into the system to improve the efficiency </li>
                    <li>Issues that surfaced with the use of the system which were identified during the SDLC can be solved </li>
                    <li>Developing the new system to suit the new requirements </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are several models for SDLC each model facilitates the system in different ways </p>
                <p>Some examples for theses models are</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Waterfall model</li>
                    <li>Iterative incremental model</li>
                    <li>Prototyping model</li>
                    <li>Spiral model</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The waterfall model consist of several stages of linear development </p>
                <p>To develop system using the waterfall model</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First identify requirements</li>
                    <li>Finish one stage before the next</li>
                    <li>The result of he developed system is found at the final stage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The result of he developed system is found at the final stage</p>
                <p>The iterative incremental model allows software developers to take advantage of what was learned during the development and use it on the system</p>
                <p>In this model a system is developed through repeated cycles and in smaller portions at a time </p>
