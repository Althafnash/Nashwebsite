                <h1>System Development Life Cycle</h1>
                <p>A system is a collection of components that interact together to achieve a specific task.</p>
                <p>A system converts data into information.</p>
                
                <h3>Manual System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors are minimal when data is processed by a computer program.</li>
                    <li>Since data is inserted manually, there is more room for error.</li>
                    <li>Processing of data is less efficient.</li>
                    <li>Requires a large space for storage of data.</li>
                    <li>Data is open to many threats.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Advantages of Using a Computer-Based System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors are minimal when data is processed by a computer program.</li>
                    <li>Data can be processed more efficiently.</li>
                    <li>Large amounts of data can be stored on a small physical surface such as a database.</li>
                    <li>Security can be ensured with backups and the use of passwords.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Stages of the System Development Life Cycle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification of requirements</li>
                    <li>Designing the solution</li>
                    <li>Coding of the solution</li>
                    <li>Testing and debugging</li>
                    <li>Deployment of the system</li>
                    <li>Maintenance of the system</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Ways of Identifying Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Observing</li>
                    <li>Interviews</li>
                    <li>Questionnaires</li>
                    <li>Document sample collection</li>
                    <li>Prototyping</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Key Points in Designing Software</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification of software and software architecture</li>
                    <li>User interface</li>
                    <li>Identification of main hardware system and its components</li>
                    <li>Identification of dependencies of each subsystem</li>
                    <li>Deciding on the hardware and software to run on the computer</li>
                    <li>Designing infrastructure for the software, database, and user interface</li>
                    <li>Planning of tests</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The next step is to code the system using a suitable programming language.</p>
                <p>The main objective of testing and debugging is to minimize errors from the previous steps.</p>
                
                <h3>Phases of Testing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unit testing</li>
                    <li>Integration testing</li>
                    <li>System testing</li>
                    <li>Acceptance testing</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Unit testing involves testing each unit of the system to ensure that it functions correctly with the given inputs and produces the expected outputs.</p>
                <p>Integration testing involves combining tested and debugged units to form the complete system and testing the integrated system.</p>
                <p>System testing involves testing the entire system to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly with provided inputs.</p>
                <p>Acceptance testing involves validating the system with end users to ensure it meets their needs and requirements.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Deployment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct deployment: The existing system is completely terminated and replaced with the new system.</li>
                    <li>Parallel deployment: The existing system and the new system are used concurrently.</li>
                    <li>Pilot deployment: The new system is implemented in a selected area before full-scale deployment.</li>
                    <li>Phased deployment: The new system is deployed in stages, with each stage leading to the next until the entire system is implemented.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Once a system is installed and in use for a certain period, it requires maintenance. System maintenance may involve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adopting new technology to improve efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Addressing issues identified during the SDLC.</li>
                    <li>Developing the system to meet new requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>There are several models for the SDLC, each facilitating system development in different ways. Examples of these models include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Waterfall model</li>
                    <li>Iterative incremental model</li>
                    <li>Prototyping model</li>
                    <li>Spiral model</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The Waterfall model consists of several stages of linear development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify requirements</li>
                    <li>Complete one stage before proceeding to the next</li>
                    <li>The result of the developed system is found at the final stage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Iterative Incremental model allows software developers to build on what was learned during development, using it to improve the system. In this model, the system is developed through repeated cycles and in smaller portions at a time.</p>
