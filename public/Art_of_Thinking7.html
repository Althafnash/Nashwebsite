                <h1>Reciprocity</h1>
                <p>Psychologist Robert Cialdini has studied the phenomenon of reciprocity and has established that people have extreme difficulty being in another person’s debt.</p>
                <p>It is also an ancient technique. We find reciprocity in all species whose food supplies are subject to high fluctuation.</p>
                <p>Suppose you are a hunter-gatherer. One day you are lucky and kill a deer. You cannot possibly eat all of it in a day, and refrigerators are a few centuries away.</p>
                <p>You decide to share the deer with the group, which ensures that you will benefit from others' spoils when your hauls are less impressive. The beliefs of your buddies serve as your refrigerator.</p>
                <p>Reciprocity is a very useful survival strategy, a form of risk management. Without it, humanity—and countless other species of animals—would have become extinct.</p>
                <p>It is the core of cooperation between people (who are not related) and is an essential ingredient in economic growth and wealth creation.</p>
                <p>There would be no global economy without it—there would be no economy at all.</p>
                <p>But there is also an ugly side to reciprocity: retaliation. Revenge breeds counter-revenge, and you soon find yourself in a full-scale war.</p>
                <p>If someone approaches you in the supermarket, whether to offer you a taste of wine, a chunk of cheese, or a handful of olives, my best advice is to refuse the offer—unless you want to end up with a refrigerator full of stuff you don’t even like.</p>
