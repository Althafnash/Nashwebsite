                <h1>Operating System</h1>
                <p>A computer consists of software, hardware, and firmware.</p>
                <p>Any physical component of the computer with a defined shape is known as hardware.</p>
                <p>The booting instructions stored in the ROM (Read-Only Memory) are known as firmware.</p>
                
                <h3>How the Initial Operations of a Computer are Performed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the user powers up the CPU, it activates the BIOS (Basic Input Output System).</li>
                    <li>The first program activated is POST (Power-On Self Test) using the CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor).</li>
                    <li>After that, it reads the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the boot drive in accordance with the bootstrap loader provided by the computer manufacturer.</li>
                    <li>Then the computer loads the operating system into the RAM.</li>
                    <li>Once this is performed, the operating system takes control and displays a user interface to the user.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The process of loading the operating system into the RAM is known as booting.</p>
                <p>Software is a set of instructions given to the computer to perform a task.</p>
                
                <p>System software can be divided into three parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating system</li>
                    <li>Utility software</li>
                    <li>Language translators</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The operating system provides the user with the ability to utilize the functions of a computer by managing both hardware and software.</p>
                <p>Utility software is used to manage and analyze the software on the computer. Unlike application software, utility software differs in its complexity and operational activities.</p>
                <p>A computer program (software) is made up of a set of instructions written in a high-level language, which is closer to human language.</p>
                
                <p>Some examples of operating systems are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microsoft Windows</li>
                    <li>Apple macOS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
                    <li>Android OS</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Operating systems can be classified according to their functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single-user operating systems</li>
                    <li>Multi-user operating systems</li>
                    <li>Multi-tasking operating systems</li>
                    <li>Real-time operating systems</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The operating system that provides services to one person at a time is known as a single-user operating system.</p>
                <p>The operating system that allows multiple users to use the system simultaneously is known as a multi-user operating system.</p>
                <p>An operating system that allows running multiple processes at the same time is called a multi-tasking operating system.</p>
                <p>Real-time operating systems are systems that provide output in real time without visible delay.</p>
                
                <p>Services of an operating system include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managing the hardware of a computer</li>
                    <li>Providing an interface for user interaction</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The hardware of a computer is managed using the following processes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Process management</li>
                    <li>Memory management</li>
                    <li>Device management</li>
                    <li>File management</li>
                    <li>Security management</li>
                    <li>Network management</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>A running computer program or part of a program is called a process.</p>
                <p>All activities in a computer run as either a single process or as multiple processes.</p>
                <p>Resource management activities include the allocation of CPU time, memory, and I/O devices to each process.</p>
                <p>Ordering of processes (according to a sequence) is also performed under this management.</p>
                
                <p>Memory plays a crucial role in the functioning of a computer.</p>
                <p>The input data is stored in the RAM before being transferred to the CPU, and processed data is also stored in the RAM before being sent to the output devices.</p>
                <p>Systematic management of memory is vital for the proper functioning of a computer.</p>
                <p>The operating system utilizes both primary memory (RAM) and secondary memory efficiently to manage memory for various processes.</p>
