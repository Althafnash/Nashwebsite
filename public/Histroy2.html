                <h1>The Social Organization of Ancient Society</h1>  
                <p>Ancient people had a well-organized hierarchy.</p>
                <p>There were two types of hierarchy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vertical hierarchy</li>
                    <li>Horizontal hierarchy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>The Ancient Society of Sri Lanka</h1>
                <p>There was no technology of communication to rule far away,</p>
                <p>so to rule remote areas, they used ministers to govern these regions.</p>
                <p>In the Vallipuram Golden Plate, there is a mention of a minister named Risigiy who ruled the Jaffna area during the reign of King Vasabha.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dasagam Ethan — Head of ten villages</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If there was a problem regarding alms given to the temple, the Dasagam Ethan should gather and solve the issue.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vejasal — Hospital</li>
                    <li>Veja — Doctor</li>
                </ul>
                <p>King Buddhadasa built a hospital.</p>
                <p>King Mahinda V acted to provide everything required for the hospital in the province.</p>
                <p>During the period of King Kashyapa IV, a dangerous fever spread in and around Anuradhapura.</p>
                <p>There were three main institutions which governed the country:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Legislature</li>
                    <li>Executive</li>
                    <li>Judiciary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Legislature was the king's court.</p>
                <p>The Executive implemented the laws.</p>
                <p>The Judiciary provided justice to the countrymen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eka Asthana — King's court</li>
                    <li>Samaya — Agreement</li>
                    <li>Wath Himiyan Wadala — King's decree</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The officers named Udhaya in Menikgamuwa and Sena in Nikawella had come representing the council to offer a plot of land called Kerelegama to the nunnery called Mindarama.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maha Lekam — Great writer / Great secretary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>They were responsible for recording all government affairs and taking necessary steps to preserve them.</p>
                <p>King Kashyapa IV built a hospital for patients who were infected by the dangerous fever that spread during his time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thimbirige — Maternity hospital</li>
                </ul>
                <p>King Upatissa I built a maternity hospital for pregnant women.</p>
                <p>Our kings also mentioned maternal and trade affairs with other countries.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>King Gajabahu I arrived in Chera State in South India to participate in a ceremony where the Pathini Devalaya was declared open.</li>
                    <li>King Kanatissa sent ambassadors to Romekuladeshaya (Rome) to fetch glass pebbles for a pooja performed in the Ruwanwelisaya Maha Seya.</li>
                    <li>During King Agbo's period, to strengthen trade affairs with China, 24 missions were sent.</li>
                    <li>Sri Lanka had marital relations with neighboring countries such as Kalinga and Pandya to strengthen political power.</li>
                    <li>King Vijayabahu I appointed the Velakkara army for the protection of the Polonnaruwa Tooth Temple.</li>
                    <li>After the 10th century, our kings had mutual relations with Arabian countries to strengthen trade affairs.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Economy</h2>
                <p>There were three main sectors in the economy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Agriculture</li>
                    <li>Industries</li>
                    <li>Trade</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some of the main sectors of agriculture:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chena cultivation</li>
                    <li>Paddy cultivation</li>
                    <li>Animal husbandry</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ways of preparing a chena cultivation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A suitable land for chena is prepared for growing grains and vegetables after choosing a plot of land from a jungle.</li>
                    <li>The owner shouts to chase away the animals.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nawa Deli Hena — A new chena that has been cleared by setting fire to it.</li>
                    <li>Danu Weta — The fence that was made around the chena to protect it against wild animals.</li>
                    <li>Pela — The watch hut which was built on top of a tall tree.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The farmer stayed up sleepless at night to protect the chena from wild animals.</p>
                <p>The Nawa Deli Hena was so called because it produced nine plants, namely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finger millet (Kurakkan)</li>
                    <li>Kalu</li>
                    <li>Undu</li>
                    <li>Green gram</li>
                    <li>Corn (Iringu)</li>
                    <li>Millet (Thanahal)</li>
                    <li>Asamodagam</li>
                    <li>Amu</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The normal method practiced in chena cultivation was abandoning a chena after cultivating in it twice. Then it grows wild again, and therefore, it does not harm the environment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kanaththa — The deserted chena which was reused after being abandoned.</li>
                    <li>Ketha, Kubura — The places where paddy was cultivated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most paddy cultivation was done using irrigation. Rainwater was reserved during the rainy season and carried to paddy fields through canals.</p>
                <p>Paddy cultivation was done twice a year.</p>
                <p>There are 03 seasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yala season</li>
                    <li>Maha season</li>
                    <li>Keda season</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some of the strategies used to gather water:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gathering rainwater</li>
                    <li>Taking water to paddy fields through canals by putting a barrier across a natural river</li>
                </ul>
                <p>"Not a single drop of water that falls off the sky should be sent to the sea without properly using it." — King Parakramabahu I</p>
                <p>Rearing cattle was a major activity in animal husbandry. Inscriptions mention Gopalgam reserved for this purpose. Curd, ghee, and butter were produced. Apart from cattle, chickens and goats were also reared.</p>
                
                <h2>Industries</h2>
